# Game of life
_an attempt_

 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
